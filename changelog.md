[Release notes](https://cabrerahector.com/wordpress/wordpress-popular-posts-5-0-multiple-taxonomy-support-themes-thumbnail-lazy-loading-and-more/) | [Full Changelog](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/compare/4.2.2...5.0.0).

#### 4.2.2 ####

- You can now also pass arrays when using the parameters `post_type`, `cat`, `term_id`, `pid` or `author` (see [issue 169](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/issues/169#issuecomment-419667083) for details).
- The plugin will use language packs from wordpress.org from now on.
